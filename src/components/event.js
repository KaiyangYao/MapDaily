SUMMARY:EnviroThursday - "Lion Rangers:  Community Conservation of the Desert-Adapted Lions"
LOCATION:Olin-Rice Science Center 250
DTSTAMP:20220314T143240
DESCRIPTION:Speaker:   John Heydinger\, Co-founder of the Lion RangersHumans\, livestock\, and lions have inhabited shared landscapes in northwest Namibia for hundreds of years. Currently\, human-lion conflict (HLC) threatens pastoral livelihoods and the viability of the region’s desert-adapted lion (Panthera leo) population within communal conservancies. The Lion Rangers\, local pastoralist-conservationists\, monitor the desert-adapted lions and work communities\, government\, and researchers to limit HLC for the conservation of this iconic population. Co-founder of the Lion Rangers John Heydinger will discuss the challenges of integrating community- and evidence-based conservation within natural and social science frameworks. What are the prospects for the desert-adapted lions? For locally-led conservation in a globalizing world? What happens when rural development and wildlife conservation are in tension in the Global South? John will address these topics.A trained historian and conservation biologist\, John’s work focuses on integrating social and ecological factors for locally-centered wildlife conservation. He is currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota.

SUMMARY:Is Climate Anxiety Real?!? A Project Exploring the Mental Health Impacts of the Climate Crisis
LOCATION:Zoom
DTSTAMP:20220118T114952
DESCRIPTION:Please join the Serie Center for “Is Climate Anxiety Real?!? A Project Exploring the Mental Health Impacts of the Climate Crisis.” Christie Manning (Sustainability Office). According to 2020 polling data from the American Psychiatric Association\, the number of Americans reporting that climate change is "probably" or "definitely" affecting their mental health is 68%. This number seems shockingly high\, particularly given media analyses showing very low mentions of climate change in the broadcast media\, even after extreme storms and wildfires. During her fall 2021 professional leave/sabbatical\, Christie Manning set out to synthesize the research on climate change and mental health. Her work resulted in the co-authored report: Mental Health and our Changing Climate: Impacts\, Inequities\, Responses\, which explores the main ways climate change affects mental health and well being\, the prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes\, who is most impacted\, and what we can do about it. In this presentation and discussion she will briefly talk about the research process and share key findings. An email with the link to join the event will be sent via swap-news. All faculty and staff are welcome.

SUMMARY:The Chopin Society Presents Pianist Lukáš Vondráček
LOCATION:Music Building Mairs Concert Hall
DTSTAMP:20220224T002007
DESCRIPTION:Lukáš Vondráček\, born in 1986 in Opava\, Czech Republic\, gave his first public performance at the age of four. As a fifteen-year-old in 2002 he made his debut with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and Vladimir Ashkenazy\, which was followed by a US and European tour. Further recognition came in a long list of major competitions\, among them first prizes at the Hilton Head and San Marino International Competitions\, the Unisa International Competition in Pretoria\, South Africa\, and the Raymond E. Buck Jury Discretionary Award at the 2009 Van Cliburn. Topping off his competition awards\, Lukáš became the indisputable and unanimous winner of the Grand Prix at the 2016 Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels. Lukáš received his Artist Diploma with Honors from Boston's New England Conservatory under the tutelage of Hung-Kuan Chen. In addition to playing recitals in top venues across the globe\, he has worked extensively with a pantheon of leading conductors\, among them Paavo Järvi\, Gianandrea Noseda\, Yannick Nézet-Séguin\, Marin Alsop\, Christoph Eschenbach\, Vasily Petrenko\, Jakub Hrůša\, Anu Tali\, Xian Zhang\, Krzysztof Urbański\, and Elim Chan. Lukáš’ busy 2021-22 season includes debuts with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl and a return to the Baltimore and Chicago symphony orchestras under the baton of Marin Alsop. He is also touring and in the process of recording all the Rachmaninoff concertos with the Prague Symphony Orchestra led by Jakub Hrůša. This will be Lukáš’ third appearance on our series\, following highly memorable recitals in 2012 and 2014.“Lukáš Vondráček is a pianist in the grand style who can dazzle with his impeccable technique\, amaze with the richness and depth of his sound and enchant with his delicacy and finesse in softer passages.” —Seen and Heard International“… a pianist of immense gifts and unwavering intensity.” —Sydney Morning Herald“Pianist Lukáš Vondráček is the master of perfectly voiced textures.” —The Straits TimesPROGRAMSCHUBERTSonata in B-flat Major\, D. 960IntermissionSCHUMANNKreisleriana\, Op. 16Arabeske\, Op. 18Due to Covid-related restrictions on audience size\, this concert is now sold out.

SUMMARY:"Mom\, I am a monster" Ambivalent Motherhood in Neoliberal Times
LOCATION:Art Building AC 102
DTSTAMP:20220309T145628
DESCRIPTION:A Colloquium Talk in Spanish by Prof. Dinorah CossíoThere has been a growing interest in exploring mother-child relationships through Spanish and Argentinian cultural products. These experiences are set in a sociopolitical context defined by neoliberal regimes that deploy changes often incompatible with the upbringing of children. Many authors have attempted to question and subvert the binary categories that divide mothers into "good or bad\, " "fertile or infertile\, " "suitable or not suitable. " By means of fictional representation\, the texts analyzed in this presentation problematize the archetypes of motherhood and how socioeconomic policies influence the development of behaviors both in precarious situations and in degraded environmental settings.

LOCATION:Olin-Rice Science Center 250
DTSTAMP:20220323T093052
DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Gudrun LockThis is a project focused on the buffers of Canadian Pacific Railway owned Shoreham Yards near Gudrum Lock’s house in Northeast Minneapolis. For over two and a half years\, she has wanted to revitalize these areas where 140 years of rail and industrial activity upended pre-existing nature-made systems leaving a Superfund legacy. The Nature of Shoreham Yards project includes artists\, researchers\, scientists and locals who are imagining these “urban waste areas” as potent sites for reanimation.Gudrun Lock has always been interested in things that have been relegated to the margins because she gets bored with the assumption that business as usual is inherently natural\, inevitable\, or universally desired. Also because the margins expose the limits of a singular narrative of progress.

SUMMARY:Philosophy Colloquium: Greg P. Wong-Taylor\, Stanford University
LOCATION:DeWitt Wallace Library Harmon Room
DTSTAMP:20220329T141506
DESCRIPTION:Join the Macalester Philosophy Department for a talk by Macalester alum and Postdoctoral Scholar of Philosophy Greg P. Wong-Taylor on Kant’s Idealist Conception of Objectivity."Objectivity is often thought of as the opposite of subjectivity\, as a sort of mind-independence. Kant\, on the other hand\, characterizes it as a particular type of subjectivity\, so that instead of being mind-independent\, the objective is what depends on the mind in the right sort of way. After presenting a reading of Kant’s conception of objectivity\, I argue that his notion of an object has a much wider application than he himself thought."

Tracing incidents of harm from slavery to the present\, Ebony will argue that white supremacy is upheld by the hatred of Black women who are descendants of African slaves. If academia is truly committed to antiracist pedagogy\, we need to have a more robust analysis of how race is gendered. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of the Integrated Ecosystem of Support (IES)\, a model constructed to advocate for a politics of care to support Black women in the academy as students\, faculty\, and staff. An email with the link to join the event will be sent via swap-news. All faculty and staff are welcome.

LOCATION:The Bruno Walter Auditorium
DTSTAMP:20220105T115622
DESCRIPTION:WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE IDEA OF RESILIENCE?Going to the doctor and going to the therapist are seen as two different things in our society. Insurance companies often make it difficult and confusing to access mental health care. While more students are accessing therapy and encouraging each other to seek help\, a gap exists. For BIPOC individuals\, especially men of color\, the expectation to be “resilient and push through” creates stigma around mental health services. How can we change the way we talk about “resilience\,” and how should this shape the future of higher education? With growing demands on time\, how do we prepare students for life after college? How do we model a healthy work-life balance and encourage communities and work environments to see the mind and body as one?Join Dana Suttles\, mental health counselor and BIPOC coordinator\, and Sue Abderholden '76\, Executive Director at NAMI Minnesota\, in conversation with President Suzanne Rivera.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Heidi Roop\, Assistant Professor of Climate Science and Climate Change and Adaptation Extension Specialist at the University of MinnesotaBuilding regional climate resilience requires increased collaboration\, regional coordination\, diverse approaches and solutions\, locally relevant and useful climate information\, and targeted investments in education and capacity building. This talk will briefly summarize observed and expected climate  impacts in Minnesota and will share how a group of researchers\, professionals\, and students at  Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership (MCAP) are working together to support Minnesota’s ability to adapt to these changes. We will also explore how we can all help to catalyze the action needed to confront the many challenges of climate change.Dr. Heidi Roop is also the Director of the Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership (MCAP). Her research and Extension programs combine cutting-edge climate science and effective science communication to increase the use and integration of climate change information in decision-making at a range of scales—from city and state to national and international levels. Her forthcoming book\, Every Action Matters\, explores everyday ways we can all contribute to collective and individual climate action. Her climate science research takes her around the world where she participates in a range of projects from Antarctica and the mountains of New Zealand to the shores of Lake Superior. In addition to her appointments at the University of Minnesota\, she also is an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Washington and serves as expert advisor to a range of organizations and agencies as they seek to build resilience to climate change.

SUMMARY:Forensic Economics?!
LOCATION:Zoom
DTSTAMP:20220119T111740
DESCRIPTION:Please join the Serie Center for “Forensic Economics?!?” Gabe Lade (Economics) will describe how economists use statistics and economic theory to detect cheating in settings ranging from sports to regulatory evasion. We will then explore potential gaming under the U.S. Lead and Copper Rule in more depth.  In particular\, we will use data on reported lead values for all U.S. Public Water Systems (PWSs) from 2011-2020 and develop a new strategy to quantify manipulation to test whether PWSs engaged in undesirable reporting behavior. We will document compelling evidence that some small and medium-sized PWSs manipulated their reported lead concentrations before the Flint water crisis. This behavior drastically decreased after the Flint water crisis\, particularly for medium PWSs. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that our results are primarily driven by PWSs serving areas with higher poverty rates. An email with the link to join the event will be sent via swap-news. All faculty and staff are welcome.

SUMMARY:EnviroThursday: Environmental Studies Honors Presentations
LOCATION:Olin-Rice Science Center 250
DTSTAMP:20220405T112710
DESCRIPTION:“Land is Life:  Settler Colonial Governance of National Parks and Hunting in Taiwan”Speaker:  Jarita ChenThis thesis situates Taiwan as a settler colonial state by examining the discourse around national parks and the criminalization of Indigenous hunting in Taiwan. Jarita Chen will examine the narratives around three cases: the controversial and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Maqaw National Park\, the Tumpu Daingaz buluo’s struggle with the Yushan National Park\, and the Tama Talum Indigenous hunting constitutional reinterpretation case. In this presentation\, Jarita will focus on the story around the Maqaw National Park. This story reveals how settler narratives and environmentalism perpetuate settler colonialism through the assumption of access over Indigenous land\, cultures\, and knowledge. However\, Indigenous voices reveal a through-line of ongoing resistance and resurgence. While settler narratives portray and encourage a limiting path\, alternative Indigenous narratives show that there are expansive ways for Indigenous self-determination\, futures\, and land relations.“The Abolitionist Presence of Food in Oakland\, CA Food Deserts”Speaker:  Ayize JamesThis project takes an abolitionist approach to the study of food deserts. Carceral abolition is about creating lasting alternatives to violence in the face of the systematic abandonment of people and land by the state and capital. This project asks two questions: (1) How do interconnected processes of abandonment create food deserts? and  (2) How does abolitionist praxis make food present in a food desert? To understand how organized abandonment creates food deserts\, Ayize James considers the history and present-day context of spatially-uneven food inequities in Oakland and the East Bay. Ayize will then present three case studies to argue that abolitionist organizing by Black and Indigenous peoples in Oakland has continually made food present in places demarcated as food deserts.To-Go refreshments served at the end of presentations.

DESCRIPTION:Language is an integral site of identity formation. It's a powerful tool central to communicating experience and puzzling how exactly each of us moves through the world around us. However\, sometimes attaching definitions to identity\, especially to something as complex and individual as sexuality\, can stifle self-exploration and growth. Words are important to us\, for good or for bad. Join the GSRC to discuss whether identity labels are friend or foe.

SUMMARY:Big Questions Seattle: Is free speech possible?
LOCATION:
DTSTAMP:20211119T145012
DESCRIPTION:Freedom of speech is a cornerstone principle of the United States Constitution. From college campuses to town squares\, we have long regarded public spaces as places where speech is open and free. But we’ve seen recent examples of protests that are surveilled\, kettled\, and shut down. Much expression now happens online\, where private companies such as Facebook and Twitter exercise significant control. And many accuse higher education institutions of being among the least tolerant when speech challenges so-called "politically correct" viewpoints. Is our society capable of supporting the free exchange of ideas? What can be done to promote robust\, constructive dialogue in America?Join Dr. Patrick Schmidt\, professor of political science and co-director of the legal studies program\, in conversation with President Suzanne Rivera.  Thursday\, April 21\, 2022THE LOCATION WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOON!6:30 - 7:00 PM Reception 7:00 - 8:00 PM Presentation 8:00 - 8:30 PM Dessert Reception  COVID-19 Precautions:Macalester expects that all in-person attendees:Be fully vaccinated or obtain a negative COVID-19 test 48 hours prior to the event.

SUMMARY:The Chopin Society Presents Pianist Zlata Chochieva
LOCATION:Music Building Mairs Concert Hall
DTSTAMP:20220121T170058
DESCRIPTION:Making a welcome return to our series is Zlata Chochieva\, a pianist who continues to gain an international following for her phenomenal artistry and imaginative genius. The Moscow native trained under Mikhail Pletnev at the Central Special Music School and Pavel Nersessian at Moscow State Conservatory. There followed a period of postgraduate studies and an assistant teaching post with Professor Jacques Rouvier in Salzburg. In 2012\, with the first of three Piano Classics CDs of Chopin and Rachmaninoff\, she started earning serious attention in the music press\, and in 2016\, Gramophone placed her Chopin Etudes in its ‘Top 50 Chopin’ recordings ever. Now living in Berlin\, Zlata spent part of the pandemic lockdown giving digitally-streamed performances\, including for the “Moments Musicaux” series of the Berliner Klavierfestival. She was also inspired to put together a collection of piano transcriptions by pianist/composers Rachmaninoff\, Liszt\, and Friedman. The resulting CD\, released in early 2021\, has earned universal acclaim\, along with award nominations from Opus Klassik in the ‘Instrumentalist of the Year’ and ‘Solo Recording-Instrument’ categories. Aside from Zlata’s own performances and recordings\, she has participated in many top music festivals and established the International Festival at Rachmaninov’s estate in Ivanovka\, where she has been Director since 2018."...the possessor of a comprehensive technique who brings an inner glow to every bar.” —Gramophone“This is pianism of great character\, and the concentration Chochieva achieves over the longer span is magnetic.” —Seen and Heard InternationalPROGRAMC.P.E.

DESCRIPTION:Dr. Zeynep Devrim Gürsel will deliver the 2022 McCurdy Distinguished Lecture on Thursday\, September 22\, 2022\, in the Alexander G. Hill Ballroom in Kagin Commons. Her presentation "Portraits Of Unbelonging" will ask the audience to consider how photography has policed borders and differences. How do photography and statecraft intersect in the making and unmaking of citizens?"Portraits Of Unbelonging" is a double-sided history of migration\, examining one of the first uses of photographs to police borders. It studies the history of Ottoman Armenian emigration from the Ottoman east to the United States from the politically fraught and often violent 1890s to the end of Abdülhamid II's reign in 1909.Dr. Gürsel\, an associate professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University\, is a media anthropologist whose scholarship involves both the analysis and production of images. She is also a film director and prolific author.
