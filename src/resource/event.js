SUMMARY:"Mom\, I am a monster" Ambivalent Motherhood in Neoliberal Times
LOCATION:Art Building AC 102
DTSTAMP:20220309T145628
DESCRIPTION:A Colloquium Talk in Spanish by Prof. Dinorah CossíoThere has been a growing interest in exploring mother-child relationships through Spanish and Argentinian cultural products. These experiences are set in a sociopolitical context defined by neoliberal regimes that deploy changes often incompatible with the upbringing of children. Many authors have attempted to question and subvert the binary categories that divide mothers into "good or bad\, " "fertile or infertile\, " "suitable or not suitable. " By means of fictional representation\, the texts analyzed in this presentation problematize the archetypes of motherhood and how socioeconomic policies influence the development of behaviors both in precarious situations and in degraded environmental settings.

SUMMARY:EnviroThursday - “The Nature of Shoreham Yards”
LOCATION:Olin-Rice Science Center 250
DTSTAMP:20220323T093052
DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Gudrun LockThis is a project focused on the buffers of Canadian Pacific Railway owned Shoreham Yards near Gudrum Lock’s house in Northeast Minneapolis. For over two and a half years\, she has wanted to revitalize these areas where 140 years of rail and industrial activity upended pre-existing nature-made systems leaving a Superfund legacy. The Nature of Shoreham Yards project includes artists\, researchers\, scientists and locals who are imagining these “urban waste areas” as potent sites for reanimation.Gudrun Lock has always been interested in things that have been relegated to the margins because she gets bored with the assumption that business as usual is inherently natural\, inevitable\, or universally desired. Also because the margins expose the limits of a singular narrative of progress.

SUMMARY:Philosophy Colloquium: Greg P. Wong-Taylor\, Stanford University
LOCATION:DeWitt Wallace Library Harmon Room
DTSTAMP:20220329T141506
DESCRIPTION:Join the Macalester Philosophy Department for a talk by Macalester alum and Postdoctoral Scholar of Philosophy Greg P. Wong-Taylor on Kant’s Idealist Conception of Objectivity."Objectivity is often thought of as the opposite of subjectivity\, as a sort of mind-independence. Kant\, on the other hand\, characterizes it as a particular type of subjectivity\, so that instead of being mind-independent\, the objective is what depends on the mind in the right sort of way. After presenting a reading of Kant’s conception of objectivity\, I argue that his notion of an object has a much wider application than he himself thought."

An email with the link to join the event will be sent via swap-news. All faculty and staff are welcome.

SUMMARY:Big Questions 2022 in New York City
LOCATION:The Bruno Walter Auditorium
DTSTAMP:20220105T115622
DESCRIPTION:WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE IDEA OF RESILIENCE?Going to the doctor and going to the therapist are seen as two different things in our society. Insurance companies often make it difficult and confusing to access mental health care. While more students are accessing therapy and encouraging each other to seek help\, a gap exists. For BIPOC individuals\, especially men of color\, the expectation to be “resilient and push through” creates stigma around mental health services. How can we change the way we talk about “resilience\,” and how should this shape the future of higher education? With growing demands on time\, how do we prepare students for life after college? How do we model a healthy work-life balance and encourage communities and work environments to see the mind and body as one?Join Dana Suttles\, mental health counselor and BIPOC coordinator\, and Sue Abderholden '76\, Executive Director at NAMI Minnesota\, in conversation with President Suzanne Rivera.

LOCATION:Olin-Rice Science Center 250
DTSTAMP:20220316T142623
DESCRIPTION:Speaker:  Dr. Heidi Roop\, Assistant Professor of Climate Science and Climate Change and Adaptation Extension Specialist at the University of MinnesotaBuilding regional climate resilience requires increased collaboration\, regional coordination\, diverse approaches and solutions\, locally relevant and useful climate information\, and targeted investments in education and capacity building. This talk will briefly summarize observed and expected climate  impacts in Minnesota and will share how a group of researchers\, professionals\, and students at  Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership (MCAP) are working together to support Minnesota’s ability to adapt to these changes. We will also explore how we can all help to catalyze the action needed to confront the many challenges of climate change.Dr. Heidi Roop is also the Director of the Minnesota Climate Adaptation Partnership (MCAP). Her research and Extension programs combine cutting-edge climate science and effective science communication to increase the use and integration of climate change information in decision-making at a range of scales—from city and state to national and international levels. Her forthcoming book\, Every Action Matters\, explores everyday ways we can all contribute to collective and individual climate action. Her climate science research takes her around the world where she participates in a range of projects from Antarctica and the mountains of New Zealand to the shores of Lake Superior.

SUMMARY:Forensic Economics?!
LOCATION:Zoom
DTSTAMP:20220119T111740
DESCRIPTION:Please join the Serie Center for “Forensic Economics?!?” Gabe Lade (Economics) will describe how economists use statistics and economic theory to detect cheating in settings ranging from sports to regulatory evasion. We will then explore potential gaming under the U.S. Lead and Copper Rule in more depth.  In particular\, we will use data on reported lead values for all U.S. Public Water Systems (PWSs) from 2011-2020 and develop a new strategy to quantify manipulation to test whether PWSs engaged in undesirable reporting behavior. We will document compelling evidence that some small and medium-sized PWSs manipulated their reported lead concentrations before the Flint water crisis. This behavior drastically decreased after the Flint water crisis\, particularly for medium PWSs. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that our results are primarily driven by PWSs serving areas with higher poverty rates. An email with the link to join the event will be sent via swap-news. All faculty and staff are welcome.

SUMMARY:FAS Spring Lecture: Old Fertilizer in New Bottles: Selling the past as innovation in Africa’s Green Revolution
LOCATION:Carnegie Hall 107
DTSTAMP:20220406T072446
DESCRIPTION:Please join us for the spring Food\, Agriculture &amp\; Society Lecture. Monday\, April 11\, 12-1pm in Carnegie Hall Rm 107. Masks required. A light lunch will be served.OldFertilizer in New Bottles: Selling the past as innovation in Africa’s Green Revolution   by Timothy Wise   A growing number of farmers\, scientists\, and development experts now advocate a shift from high-input\, chemical-intensive agriculture to low-input ecological farming. They are supported by an impressive array of new research documenting both the risks of continuing to follow our current practices and the potential benefits of a transition to more sustainable farming informed by collaborations between farmers and scientists. The new initiatives have been met with a chorus of derision from an unsurprising group of commentators\, many associated with agribusiness interests. They argue that only Green Revolution seeds and fertilizers can provide the innovation needed to help regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa grow more food. This narrative\, however\, flips reality on its head. Ecological innovations are on the cutting edge of new farming practices\, while the Green Revolution is selling an outdated 50-year-old model as innovation despite its proven failures.    Timothy A. Wise is a Senior Advisor at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) and a Senior Research Fellow at Tufts University’s Global Development and Environment Institute. He is the author of Eating Tomorrow: Agribusiness\, Family Farmers and the Battle for the Future of Food (New Press 2019).

LOCATION:Humanities Building 401
DTSTAMP:20220413T124829
DESCRIPTION:The   Department of French  and Francophone Studies cordially invites you to   join us for the 2022 Phi Beta Kappa Lecture by Prof. Howard Bloch on   Thursday April 14 at 4:45 PM in Humanities 401.     Gothic cathedrals were great engines of urban   renewal in the High Middle Ages. The great religious work projects   contributed to the revival of trades and to the new institutions of   medieval towns. Not the least of these was the University of Paris\,   which grew out of the cathedral school of Notre-Dame in the second half   of the twelfth century. Using three sculptural programs on the outer   walls of Notre-Dame alongside the example of Abelard\, we shall examine   the ways in which stories carved in stone— the Miracle of Theophilus\,   the martyrdom of Saint Stephen\, and scenes of student life— affirm the   power of disputation\, writing\, and the book culture which flourished   just up the street.We are looking forward to seeing you soon!

SUMMARY:EnviroThursday: Environmental Studies Honors Presentations
LOCATION:Olin-Rice Science Center 250
DTSTAMP:20220405T112710
DESCRIPTION:“Land is Life:  Settler Colonial Governance of National Parks and Hunting in Taiwan”Speaker:  Jarita ChenThis thesis situates Taiwan as a settler colonial state by examining the discourse around national parks and the criminalization of Indigenous hunting in Taiwan. Jarita Chen will examine the narratives around three cases: the controversial and ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Maqaw National Park\, the Tumpu Daingaz buluo’s struggle with the Yushan National Park\, and the Tama Talum Indigenous hunting constitutional reinterpretation case. In this presentation\, Jarita will focus on the story around the Maqaw National Park. This story reveals how settler narratives and environmentalism perpetuate settler colonialism through the assumption of access over Indigenous land\, cultures\, and knowledge. However\, Indigenous voices reveal a through-line of ongoing resistance and resurgence. While settler narratives portray and encourage a limiting path\, alternative Indigenous narratives show that there are expansive ways for Indigenous self-determination\, futures\, and land relations.“The Abolitionist Presence of Food in Oakland\, CA Food Deserts”Speaker:  Ayize JamesThis project takes an abolitionist approach to the study of food deserts. Carceral abolition is about creating lasting alternatives to violence in the face of the systematic abandonment of people and land by the state and capital. This project asks two questions: (1) How do interconnected processes of abandonment create food deserts? and  (2) How does abolitionist praxis make food present in a food desert? To understand how organized abandonment creates food deserts\, Ayize James considers the history and present-day context of spatially-uneven food inequities in Oakland and the East Bay. Ayize will then present three case studies to argue that abolitionist organizing by Black and Indigenous peoples in Oakland has continually made food present in places demarcated as food deserts.To-Go refreshments served at the end of presentations.

SUMMARY:Holy Thursday Supper and Service (Western Church)
LOCATION:Weyerhaeuser Memorial Chapel
DTSTAMP:20220406T151132
DESCRIPTION:The table is a place of community and communion. In the Christian tradition\, a table is also a place of spiritual significance because Jesus shared the last supper with his disciples at a table.  The importance of this is most visible through the sacramental practice of communion\, eucharist\, or the last supper\, observed in much of the church.  If  you are curious about this ritual or hungry for connection this Holy Week you are welcome at our 6-7pm Holy Thursday Gathering. There will be a simple soup supper and an opportunity to tell the story of the Last Supper. This space is meant to be nourishing to all and the table is open to all\, without exception. This day is sometimes called Holy Thursday\, Maundy Thursday\, Thursday of Mysteries. An appropriate greeting is “Happy Holy Thursday”.

However\, sometimes attaching definitions to identity\, especially to something as complex and individual as sexuality\, can stifle self-exploration and growth. Words are important to us\, for good or for bad. Join the GSRC to discuss whether identity labels are friend or foe.

SUMMARY:Arnold H. Lowe Endowed Lecture: Dr. Edward E. Curtis IV\, Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI
LOCATION:DeWitt Wallace Library Harmon Room
DTSTAMP:20220413T023930
DESCRIPTION:The Religious Studies Department cordially invites you to the 2022 Lowe Lecture: Dr. Edward E. Curtis IV\, William M. and Gail M. Plater Chair of Liberal Arts &amp\; Professor of Religious Studies at Indiana University School of Liberal Arts at IUPUI will give a talk based on his book titled "Muslims of the Heartland." Dr. Curtis is the recipient of fellowships and grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities\, the Carnegie Corporation of New York\, the Fulbright Scholar Program\, the Andrew Mellon Foundation\, the American Academy of Religion\, and the National Humanities Center. The award-winning author or editor of fourteen books\, including a new book on Arab Americans in Indianapolis\, Dr. Curtis has contributed interviews and articles to the New York Times\, the Wall Street Journal\, the Washington Post\, National Public Radio\, and the Associated Press.RSVP Dinner will follow in the 4th Floor Lounge of Old Main.The American Midwest is often thought of as uniformly white\, and shaped exclusively by Christian values. But this view of the region as an unvarying landscape fails to consider a significant community at its very heart. Muslims of the Heartland shows how the first two generations of Midwestern Syrians created a life that was Arab\, Muslim\, and American\, all at the same time. Edward E. Curtis IV\, a descendant of Syrian Midwesterners\, vividly portrays the intrepid men and women who busted sod on the short-grass prairies of the Dakotas\, peddled needles and lace on the streets of Cedar Rapids\, and worked in the railroad car factories of Michigan City. Muslims of the Heartland recreates what the Syrian Muslim Midwest looked\, sounded\, felt\, and smelled like—from the allspice-seasoned lamb and rice shared in mosque basements to the sound of the trains on the Rock Island Line rolling past the dry goods store. It recovers a multicultural history of the American Midwest that cannot be ignored.

SUMMARY:Big Questions Seattle: Is free speech possible?
LOCATION:
DTSTAMP:20211119T145012
DESCRIPTION:Freedom of speech is a cornerstone principle of the United States Constitution. From college campuses to town squares\, we have long regarded public spaces as places where speech is open and free. But we’ve seen recent examples of protests that are surveilled\, kettled\, and shut down. Much expression now happens online\, where private companies such as Facebook and Twitter exercise significant control. And many accuse higher education institutions of being among the least tolerant when speech challenges so-called "politically correct" viewpoints. Is our society capable of supporting the free exchange of ideas? What can be done to promote robust\, constructive dialogue in America?Join Dr. Patrick Schmidt\, Macalester professor of political science and co-director of the legal studies program and Sarah Johnson ’97\, attorney focusing on municipal and education law\, in conversation with President Suzanne M. Rivera.  Thursday\, April 21\, 2022First &amp\; Bell6:30 - 7:00 PM Reception 7:00 - 8:00 PM Presentation 8:00 - 8:30 PM Dessert Reception  COVID-19 Precautions:At these events\, we strongly encourage attendees to be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations\; however\, they will not be required.

SUMMARY:The Chopin Society Presents Pianist Zlata Chochieva
LOCATION:Music Building Mairs Concert Hall
DTSTAMP:20220121T170058
DESCRIPTION:Making a welcome return to our series is Zlata Chochieva\, a pianist who continues to gain an international following for her phenomenal artistry and imaginative genius. The Moscow native trained under Mikhail Pletnev at the Central Special Music School and Pavel Nersessian at Moscow State Conservatory. There followed a period of postgraduate studies and an assistant teaching post with Professor Jacques Rouvier in Salzburg. In 2012\, with the first of three Piano Classics CDs of Chopin and Rachmaninoff\, she started earning serious attention in the music press\, and in 2016\, Gramophone placed her Chopin Etudes in its ‘Top 50 Chopin’ recordings ever. Now living in Berlin\, Zlata spent part of the pandemic lockdown giving digitally-streamed performances\, including for the “Moments Musicaux” series of the Berliner Klavierfestival. She was also inspired to put together a collection of piano transcriptions by pianist/composers Rachmaninoff\, Liszt\, and Friedman. The resulting CD\, released in early 2021\, has earned universal acclaim\, along with award nominations from Opus Klassik in the ‘Instrumentalist of the Year’ and ‘Solo Recording-Instrument’ categories. Aside from Zlata’s own performances and recordings\, she has participated in many top music festivals and established the International Festival at Rachmaninov’s estate in Ivanovka\, where she has been Director since 2018."...the possessor of a comprehensive technique who brings an inner glow to every bar.” —Gramophone“This is pianism of great character\, and the concentration Chochieva achieves over the longer span is magnetic.” —Seen and Heard InternationalPROGRAMC.P.E.

SUMMARY:2022 McCurdy Distinguished Lecture: Dr. Zeynep Devrim Gürsel
LOCATION:Ruth Stricker Dayton Campus Center John B. Davis Lecture Hall
DTSTAMP:20211123T103126
DESCRIPTION:Dr. Zeynep Devrim Gürsel will deliver the 2022 McCurdy Distinguished Lecture on Thursday\, September 22\, 2022\, in the Alexander G. Hill Ballroom in Kagin Commons. Her presentation "Portraits Of Unbelonging" will ask the audience to consider how photography has policed borders and differences. How do photography and statecraft intersect in the making and unmaking of citizens?"Portraits Of Unbelonging" is a double-sided history of migration\, examining one of the first uses of photographs to police borders. It studies the history of Ottoman Armenian emigration from the Ottoman east to the United States from the politically fraught and often violent 1890s to the end of Abdülhamid II's reign in 1909.Dr. Gürsel\, an associate professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University\, is a media anthropologist whose scholarship involves both the analysis and production of images. She is also a film director and prolific author. Presentation 4:45-6 p.m.Ruth Stricker Dayton Campus Center\,John B. Davis Lecture HallReception to followWeyerhaeuser Board Room
