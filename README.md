### Campus Events

In the events panel, once selected a date, a list of event cards will show up, listing the basic info of each event and the hyperlinks to the event page. If an event is happening in-person at macalester, the specific building related will be highlighted on the map once the event card is clicked.

### Dining Places

In the restaurants panel, a list of restaurants near campus with walking distance is shown. You could explore any of them you like and a single click will direct you to the main page of the restaurant.
